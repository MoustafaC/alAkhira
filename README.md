## README
This is the (al Akhira) git repository. This is where we store most of the code assets for the game.

You will need to install the latest version of Godot to work within the game. Simply clone the repo into a work directory, and import the engine.cfg file into Godot.

To access the Blender 3D art models, you will need to have Resilio Sync installed.
