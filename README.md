## README
This is the الأخرة (al Akhira) git repository. This is where we store most of the code assets for the game.

You will need to install the latest version of Godot to work within the game. Simply clone the repo into a work directory, and import the engine.godot file into Godot.

The Blender files are stored in a separate repository to ease on the repo size.
