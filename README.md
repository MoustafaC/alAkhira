## README
This is the الأخرة (al Akhira) git repository. This is where we store most of the game assets (including code, imported models and textures) for the project.

You will need to install the latest version of Godot to work within the game. Simply clone the repo into a work directory, and import the *project.godot* file into Godot.

The Blender files are stored in a separate repository to ease on this repo's size.
